## Project Overview

In this project, you will explore the world of ES6 classes and learn how to work with them in JavaScript. ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced a more structured and intuitive way to define and work with classes in JavaScript. You'll discover how to define classes, add methods to them, create static methods, extend classes, and even delve into metaprogramming and symbols. By the end of this project, you'll be well-versed in modern JavaScript class syntax and be able to explain the concepts to anyone without the need for external references.

## Learning Objectives:

-   How to define a Class
-   How to add methods to a class
-   Why and how to add a static method to a class
-   How to extend a class from another
-   Metaprogramming and symbols
