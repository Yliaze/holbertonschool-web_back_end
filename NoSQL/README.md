## Project Overview

In this project, you'll delve into the world of NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB. NoSQL databases are a valuable alternative to traditional SQL databases, offering flexibility and scalability. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document storage model. This project will introduce you to the core concepts of NoSQL and MongoDB. You'll learn about the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, the ACID properties, document storage, types of NoSQL databases, and the benefits of using a NoSQL database. You'll also dive into practical aspects, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting information from a MongoDB database.

## Learning Objectives:

-   What NoSQL means
