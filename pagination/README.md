## Project Overview

In this project, you'll dive into the world of pagination, a common technique for breaking down large sets of data into smaller, manageable chunks. Pagination is essential in web applications, where you want to display data across multiple pages rather than overwhelming users with all the information at once. You'll learn how to implement pagination in Python applications, making your code more efficient and user-friendly. This project will cover various aspects of pagination, including retrieving and displaying data, handling user interactions, and ensuring a seamless browsing experience..

## Learning Objectives:

-   How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
-   How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
-   How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner
