## Project Overview

This project will guide you through the world of asynchronous programming in JavaScript using Promises. Asynchronous operations are common in modern web development, and understanding how to work with Promises is crucial for handling asynchronous tasks effectively. You'll explore the concept of Promises, learning how and why they are used. Additionally, you'll dive into using methods like `then`, `resolve`, `catch`, and explore the `await` operator and `async` functions. Mastering these concepts will enable you to handle asynchronous tasks with finesse.

## Learning Objectives:

-   Promises (how, why, and what)
-   How to use the  `then`,  `resolve`,  `catch`  methods
-   How to use every method of the Promise object
-   Throw / Try
-   The await operator
-   How to use an  `async`  function
